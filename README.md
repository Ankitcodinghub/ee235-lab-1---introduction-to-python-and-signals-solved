EE 235 Lab 1 ‚Äì Introduction to Python and Signals

In this lab, you will work through a series of exercises to introduce you to Python with an emphasis on the basics that you need to know for working with signals. You will learn to use variables, perform basic operations, and write your own scripts to run in Jupyter Notebook.

Lab 1 Turn-in Checklist

<ul>
<li>Pre-lab: Show that you have installed or can access the necessary software by creating a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates basic Python functions and uploading it to canvas.</li>
<li>5 Assignment check-offs with TA</li>
<li>Lab 1 Jupyter notebook with code for each assignment in individual cells and with
markdown cells used for the lab overview and response to report questions.

Note: All assignments except the prelab should be completed in groups of 3-4 people.

Pre-lab

Read Sections 1-3 of the Background document. Set up your laptop in order to be able to use Python and Jupyter notebook. Section 2 describes one option, which is to use Anaconda. You can also use ECE or CoE remote desktop services. See the ECE computing page for more information.

Create a Jupyter notebook (prelab1.ipynb) that demonstrates the use of print, playing audio, and creating documentation using a markdown cell to your TA, as outlined in section 3 of the Background document. You will need to download the audio file provided on the Lab 1 assignment web page and save it in the same directory as your Lab 1 notebook. Save the prelab1 notebook and submit the file to the lab 1 assignment on Canvas.

Download the template notebook for lab 1 (TemplateL1.ipynb) and rename it Lab1-XYZ, where XYZ are the initials of the lab partners. Your Lab 1 notebook should be organized according to this template.

Lab Assignments

This lab has 5 assignments. Each should be given a separate code cell in your Notebook, and each should be followed by a markdown cell with discussion. Your notebook should start with a markdown title and overview cell, which should be followed by an import cell that has the import statements for all assignments.

Assignment 1: Creating and Manipulating Arrays

Read Section 4 of the Background document. This assignment will have four parts, A-D, each of which should be indicated with comments, following the guidelines in the Lab 1 template. In creating arrays, you should use numpy, so don‚Äôt forget to import it.

C. Create two arrays of length 5. The first (x1) should have all elements take the value 2, and the second (x2) should range from [-2,2]. Use the ones and arange attributes of numpy. Print x1 and x2.

D. Create arrp = x1+x2, and arrc as the concatenation of x1 and x2. Print arrp and arrc.

Run the code in this cell and verify that the results are what you expect.

<ol>
<li>Create time sample vectors for the audio signals from Assignment 3 (y1 and y2) using the original sampling frequency for each, and name them t1 and t2. (You will need to use the signal lengths you found in that assignment.)</li>
<li>Plot the two signals side by side using a 1√ó2 subplot. Adjust the x and y axis limits to have the same ranges in both plots. Be sure to title the plots and label axes appropriately. For the time axis, you should plot time in msec, for which you will need to multiple the time array by 1000 as in the example in the Background document. Do not use grids on the subplots. Adjust the spacing to avoid overlap.</li>

Team Report

When you‚Äôve tested and cleaned up all your code (remember, you should only submit code for the Assignments, each in their own cell), go to ‚ÄòFile‚Äô then ‚ÄòDownload as‚Äô, then select ‚Äò.ipynb‚Äô. The file you download is a Notebook that your TA will be able to open and grade for you, once you submit it on Canvas. Remember, only one notebook per team! Make sure that your notebook is titled Lab1-XYZ.ipynb, where XYZ are the initials of the lab partners. You may want to also download the file as pdf to have a nicer documentation of your records.
